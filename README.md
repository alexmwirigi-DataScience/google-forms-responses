# Google Forms Practice Project

This repository contains a practice project where I learned how to use **Google Forms** for data collection. It was a part of my learning journey to get hands-on experience with Google Workspace tools.

## About the Project

In this project, I created a simple **Google Form** to collect responses. The data collected from the form is stored in a **Google Sheets** document and exported as a **CSV file**. This repository contains the CSV file with the data I gathered.

- **Google Form Link**: (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeq_uxPzjR0EH0J2Qc1gw0IT_2n5j0R7Qne3qqj8btSJ6rtCQ/viewform?usp=sharing))

## Data Collected

The data was collected via the **Google Form** and includes information about customer feedback. You can access the data in the CSV file above:



### Notes:
- This is a practice exercise for learning how to use Google Forms and Google Sheets.
- The data is not from any actual survey or business, but rather a demonstration of the process.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Access the Google Form**: You can fill out the form and add your own responses by visiting the [[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeq_uxPzjR0EH0J2Qc1gw0IT_2n5j0R7Qne3qqj8btSJ6rtCQ/viewform?usp=sharing]   
2. **View the Data**: You can download and view the data stored in the CSV file within this repository.
3. **Contribute**: If you have suggestions or feedback on improving the form or the data collection process, feel free to create an issue or pull request!

## Conclusion

This project was created to get comfortable using **Google Forms** and to practice **data collection** and **data management** using Google tools. Itâ€™s a small, hands-on project, but it gave me the opportunity to better understand these tools and their integration.

 

Feel free to explore the repository and see how Google Forms and Sheets can be used for easy data collection and organization.
